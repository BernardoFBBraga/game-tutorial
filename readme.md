This experiment intends to show a few things:

1- How to set up a super slim experiment (in the age of create-react-app)

2- How to manipulate a canvas element

3- How to set up something similar to a game engine to update the screen

To run, use any simple http server such as python's:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
